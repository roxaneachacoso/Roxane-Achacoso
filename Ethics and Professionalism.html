  <h1>7 Ethical Principles in Nursing</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p>
      All nurses, regardless of practice area, make decisions in the course of their daily duties that require ethical consideration. But as any nurse will tell you, these decisions can weigh heavily on a person’s shoulders. A core set of ethical principles in nursing offers a solid foundation that nurses can rely on to help them make sound decisions. Such ethical principles likely contribute to the fact that, historically, Americans trust nurses more than any other profession, according to Gallup’s annual Honesty and Ethics poll.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Principles of Ethics in Nursing: Background</h2>
    <p>
      Ethics refers to how people think and conduct themselves in terms of right and wrong. The concept of nursing ethics began to develop in the late 19th century. At the time, ethics in nursing referred to certain character traits like obedience, physician loyalty, and high moral character.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the world and the healthcare industry evolves, so too must nursing ethics themselves. Nurses face increasingly complex human rights and ethical issues. In response, the American Nurses Association developed its Code of Ethics for Nurses, which serves as the standard by which all nurses should practice. It acts as a social contract between nurses and the general public, helping people understand the commitment all nurses make to providing safe, evidence-based, high-quality care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each member of the profession adheres to a set of core ethical principles in nursing. The nursing code of ethics helps nurses make good judgment calls, provide high-quality care, and support patients and their loved ones emotionally, physically, and mentally. It also helps keep a nurse’s license in good standing.

    <h2>What Are the 7 Ethical Principles in Nursing?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Accountability</li>
      <li>Justice</li>
      <li>Nonmaleficence</li>
      <li>Autonomy</li>
      <li>Beneficence</li>
      <li>Fidelity</li>
      <li>Veracity</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <div class="principle">
      <h3>1. Accountability</h3>
      <p>
        Each nurse must be responsible for his or her own choices and actions in the course of patient care. Nurses who hold themselves accountable often provide higher-quality patient care and build stronger relationships with patients.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
      <h3>2. Justice</h3>
      <p>
        Nurses must make care decisions based only on the facts—not on factors like age, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, or sexual orientation. Acting as fair and impartial caregivers ensures that each patient is treated with dignity and equity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
      <h3>3. Nonmaleficence</h3>
      <p>
        Nurses must take action to prevent harm. This principle—“do no harm”—is fundamental to safe, effective care and a nurse’s responsibility.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
      <h3>4. Autonomy</h3>
      <p>
        Patients have the right to make their own decisions. Nurses must support this right, even when a patient's choice differs from medical advice, as long as informed consent is given.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
      <h3>5. Beneficence</h3>
      <p>
        This principle means acting in the best interest of the patient. Nurses must practice kindness and charity, always considering the unique needs and situations of each person they care for.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
      <h3>6. Fidelity</h3>
      <p>
        Fidelity means keeping promises. Trust and loyalty between a nurse and patient help build strong, therapeutic relationships and ensure effective care.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
      <h3>7. Veracity</h3>
      <p>
        Even when the truth is difficult to share, nurses must be honest. This builds trust, empowers patients, and ensures informed decisions.
      </p>

    <h2>Nursing Ethical Principles in Practice</h2>
    <p>
      Most nursing programs include ethics training. These principles are often applied naturally in real-life situations. Here are some practical examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Discarding incorrect medication instead of giving it to the patient.</li>
      <li><strong>Justice:</strong> Advocating for a patient in need of financial or disability-related support.</li>
      <li><strong>Nonmaleficence:</strong> Always double-checking medication, even for familiar patients.</li>
      <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> Respecting a patient’s care decision, even when you disagree clinically.</li>
      <li><strong>Beneficence:</strong> Helping a patient weigh the pros and cons of treatment options.</li>
      <li><strong>Fidelity:</strong> Keeping a promise of confidentiality to your patient.</li>
      <li><strong>Veracity:</strong> Telling a patient the full truth about their condition with empathy.</li>
    </ul>
