  <h1>SBAR: Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation</h1>

  <p>
    SBAR is a structured communication framework widely used in healthcare settings to facilitate concise, focused, and effective conversations among team members. It stands for <strong>Situation, Background, Assessment,</strong> and <strong>Recommendation</strong> (or Request).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Promotes clarity during critical conversations.</li>
    <li>Allows all team members, including nurses, physicians, and specialists, to speak up with confidence.</li>
    <li>Essential in emergencies, deteriorating patient conditions, or discussions with external consultants.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps of SBAR</h2>

  <h3>1. Situation</h3>
  <p>
    Clearly describe what is currently happening. Include your name, role, the patient’s name, age, gender, and the immediate issue.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Background</h3>
  <p>
    Share relevant clinical background: medical history, presenting symptoms, past treatments, recent lab or diagnostic results.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Assessment</h3>
  <p>
    Explain your clinical judgment. What do you think is going on? Provide a working diagnosis if possible or describe signs and symptoms and their implications.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Recommendation / Request</h3>
  <p>
    Clearly state what you need, when you need it, and confirm understanding by repeating the response you receive.
  </p>

  <h2>Tips for Using SBAR Effectively</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Always introduce yourself.</li>
    <li>Use actual SBAR phrases like: "The situation is...", "The background is..." to stay on track.</li>
    <li>Adapt the structure based on the urgency and context.</li>
    <li>SBAR can be taught to patients and families to help them communicate with the care team.</li>
  </ul>
